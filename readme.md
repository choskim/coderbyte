## Introduction ##

This repository contains my implementation for code challenges found on [Coderbyte][1].

Many of the identifers used in Coderbyte are unconventional. I have, in turn, re-named many of them to fit current naming conventions. 

### Progress on Challenges: ###
- Easy Difficulty (0/26)
- Medium Difficulty (0/29)
- Hard Difficulty (0/16)
